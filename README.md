# GiftBox ‚Äì Crypto Gift Cards

## Project Description

GiftBox is a revolutionary smart contract platform built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to create, send, and redeem cryptocurrency gift cards. The platform transforms the traditional concept of gift cards into a decentralized, secure, and transparent system where users can gift cryptocurrency to friends, family, or colleagues with personalized messages.

The smart contract facilitates seamless peer-to-peer gifting by allowing senders to lock a specific amount of AptosCoin along with a custom message into a gift card that can only be redeemed by the designated recipient. This creates a unique and meaningful way to share cryptocurrency while maintaining the surprise and personal touch of traditional gift-giving.
